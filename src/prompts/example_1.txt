I didn't have any new material to do, and I wasn't going to do any of my old stuff now that I've gotten through the contest. And I was like, no, keep going. Don't. Sorry, I interrupted you.

I didn't perform because I didn't get to see you at the contest. Yeah! I don't have my ID on me. So if we went straight there, that might be an issue. I might have to stop by my apartment.

I'm probably going to try to do something new, which means I'll be trying to compose half of it on stage. It may not be that good.

it's really unpredictable. Sometimes there's enough audience that it's, you know, that it's worth going to as an audience member. Sometimes it's just really quiet. And you need mighty to get in.

I don't know. I can't remember. Usually by like 8 is when often times restaurants and bars, restaurant bars start asking for IDs.

seeing kids there ever. So you probably do have to show it to them. Where is it? It's right near Kelly's actually. It's just a few blocks away. It's like Yom Hill and...

There will probably be better times to see me, like hopefully I'll get into some actual shows now, especially now that I have a good video to show.

go to an open mic, like, there are better ones than this one. So is this the first time that you've done, like, 100% recorded?

Or I take videos on my phone too, but this is the first professional recording I've had in a year. It makes a difference for the sound. And then...

Bookers say they try to look past whatever venue you're in, like if you're just in some cheesy bar with, you know, the book's cheap, they'll try to judge the material by, you know, what they see you doing, but it really does have.

club with a it's fairly packed and fairly loud we'll definitely keep me in the loop

I just definitely want to be bringing people to my shows. I don't know, it's a funny time of year. During the summer, when people want to be outside.

It will not be until like September that there are a lot of shows being booked. But I'm going to try to schmooze around a lot. Good to see you, man. Good to see you again.

I usually have to wait around now.

So I'll take some of it. I'll probably eat it. I'll do it in the bathroom. Yeah. I'll let y'all divvy it up amongst yourselves. Alright. See ya.

What bus are you going to take? I could take the...

Okay, I'm probably taking the 12, because that goes near my place.
